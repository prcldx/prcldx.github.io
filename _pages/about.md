I'm a third-year graduate student from Shanghai Jiaotong University. My research interest includes wearable sensing, rehabilitation, and myoelectric control. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Peter Shull](http://www.wearablesystems.org/peter-shull) of Wearable systems Lab. You can find my [CV](../assets/CV_Dongxuan_Li.pdf) here. If you want to have a nice talk with me, don't hesitate to [email](mailto:sjtu_dongxuanli@sjtu.edu.cn) me.
